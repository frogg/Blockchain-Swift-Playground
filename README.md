Have you heard about Bitcoin or Ethereum? Or do you even own such cryptocurrencies? They all use an exciting technology called 'Blockchain' that allows creating consensus on a decentralized network. In this playground you will create your own blockchain within three minutes and learn what makes this technology so special!

# Background
I submitted this playground to this year's [Apple WWDC scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/) application and got rewarded with a WWDC scholarship ticket. Some people might have interest to use my playground to teach others about distributed ledger technologies, that's why I open sourced this project.
If you find any bugs, mistakes or areas to improve this project, please let me know by filing an issue here (or PR).
